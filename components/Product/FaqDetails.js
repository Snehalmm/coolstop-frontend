                    Most of our deliveries are on an 8am â€“ 5pm delivery service
                    with no confirmed ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival). Usually,
                    our external couriers will contact you approx. 30 minutes
                    before arriving at the delivery location. Orders that are
                    being delivered in Zone 1 by our own vehicles will be given
                    a morning or afternoon time slot, which is confirmed by text
                    message within 24 hours of delivery. Our suppliers work on
                    an all-day service up until 6pm and do not give out time
                    frames. If you are expecting a delivery, you can contact our
                    Online Customer Support Team to see if they can obtain an
                    ETA for your order.

                    on the day of delivery with a picture of the wrong product
                    you have received. Our Online Customer Support Team will
                    always ask for a picture. This is so that your picture can
                    be shown to the dispatch department or suppliers to prove
                    that the wrong product has been picked and sent, and to
                    arrange adequate collection facilities. Sending photographic
                    evidence of the incorrectly delivered product(s) dispels any
                    doubt and allows us to provide a swift resolution. Once this
                    has been investigated, we will raise a collection for the
                    incorrect product and arrange re-delivery of the correct
                    product, free of charge. Our Online Customer Support Team
                    will keep you up to date with collection and re-delivery
                    dates. Usually, this will be on the same day but may not be
                    at the same time depending on the delivery company.

                    If a product that you have ordered suddenly becomes out of
                    stock, you will receive a message advising you of this. This
                    message should contain a date or an estimated time frame for
                    when the stock is due back in. Though we have a live stock
                    feed on our website, there may still be a few occasions
                    where stock sells out quickly. If a product that you wish to
                    order is displayed as 'Out Of Stock' on the website, the
                    option to add the product to your trolley is removed. This
                    will only be changed once the product is confirmed to be
                    back in stock again. You can check stock levels and find out
                    when stock may be due back in by emailing our Online

                    Our prices displayed online have already been discounted to
                    a trade rate. We aim to keep our prices as low as possible
                    for our customers, and will always offer the best price
                    available at the time. We currently do not offer any
                    discount codes online. The only additional discount we will
                    offer online will be for orders purchased in bulk or large
                    scale projects. If you wish to enquire about this, our
                    estimating team will be happy to help. They can put together
                    a quotation and send it to you for review within 24-48
                    hours.

                    You can check the status of your order by logging into your
                    online account. Your status will show either: PENDING,
                    PROCESSING, HOLD, COMPLETED or CLOSED. Here is a breakdown
                    of each one and what they mean:

                        and is due to be processed by our E-Commerce team. This
                        is the best time to call us if you wish to cancel or
                        remove any item(s) from the order.&nbsp;

                      <li>
                        PROCESSING - This means that your order has now been
                        picked up by our E-commerce team who have sent your
                        order to the appropriate department to be picked and
                        packed, or it has been sent to one of our suppliers who
                        will deliver your order direct. At this stage, you will
                        receive email notification regarding your order.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        HOLD - This means that your order is being delayed and
                        we are awaiting a response from you. An email will have
                        been sent to you explaining why your order is on hold.
                        Once you respond to this we can then update the status
                        of your order.

                        our online archives for the next 6 years.{" "}

                    Currently, our Online Customer Support Team cannot take an
                    order over the phone. You can place an order with a member
                    of the branch sale team at a local branch to yourself. To do
                    this, you will need to call the branch directly.
